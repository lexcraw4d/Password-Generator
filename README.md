# About
The Random Password Generator was created to generate a password for users based off their response to the prompts and confirms. The password generator was created to meet the following conditions:

```WHEN the user clicks the button to generate a password
THEN they are presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN they select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN they choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters**
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN they choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN they answer each prompt
THEN their input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
